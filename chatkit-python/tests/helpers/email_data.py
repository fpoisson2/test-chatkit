CHATKIT_ROADMAP = """Hey Zach,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to give you a quick update on our ChatKit roadmap progress and get your thoughts on a few key items.

We've made solid progress on the widget system - the interactive components are working great and the demos are looking polished. The source annotations feature is about 70% complete and should be ready for testing next week.

A few questions for you:
- How are you feeling about the current mobile experience? I know we flagged some scrolling issues
- Should we prioritize the attachment error handling before the next release?
- Any thoughts on the enhanced widgets roadmap item?

Looking forward to hearing your feedback. Let me know if you want to hop on a quick call to discuss.

Best,
David"""

BRAINSTORM_SESSION = """Hey team,

While I'm in town this week, I'd love to organize a brainstorm session around our widget strategy. I've been thinking about some interesting directions we could take the interactive components.

Here's what I'm envisioning:
• 90-minute working session
• Focus on widget UX patterns and developer experience
• Whiteboard some ideas for enhanced widget types
• Maybe tackle the mobile widget experience too

I'm free Thursday afternoon or Friday morning. Let me know what works for everyone's schedule.

Also, if anyone has specific widget pain points or feature requests, bring them along - would be great to address real developer needs.

Excited to collaborate in person!

Tyler"""
